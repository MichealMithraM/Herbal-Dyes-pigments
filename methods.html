            <h4>To Prepare Henna (Mehendi) Hair Color Pack</h4>
            
            <pre>
                • Take henna powder in a bowl
                • Sift this henna to ensure no lumps are present in the henna taken to apply on the hair
                • Add a little black tea water in this henna
                • And let it soak for over 6-8 hours
                • Apply this paste on hair and wash it off with water (no shampoo or conditioner)

                • Apply this paste on the hair and wash it off after 30 minutes
                • Use a shampoo and a conditioner after 1-2 days of this entire process to get a deep black</pre>
                <br>
            <h3>2.Amla</h3>
            <h4>Add amla to your hair Mask</h4>
            <p> This amla-based hair mask is made using amla in combination with yoghurt and banana. Not only will it cleanse your hair and scalp but will also have long term benefits such as stronger roots and reduced hair fall.
            </p>
            <img src="img/amla oil.jfif" alt="">
            <h4>
                To prepare the amla hair mask</h4>
            <pre>
                • Mix 1 teaspoon of amla with 3 teaspoons of yoghurt.
                • And half a mashed banana.
                • Apply this paste to your scalp and along the length of your hair.
                • Let it stay for 20 to 25 minutes before washing it off with water.

            <h4> Or as a hair rinse</h4>
            <p>  
                Using an amla hair rinse is a great way to add a boost of proteins and antioxidants to your hair care routine. Add ½ cup of amla juice to 100ml water and pour it over your scalp and tresses.
                After you’re done washing your hair, pour this hair rinse over your scalp and tresses. You can choose to wash it out but leaving it on will have greater effects for your hair health!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>3.Reetha</h3>
            <p> Reetha can be used for hair treatment in two different forms- liquid or powder. Other ingredients like amla, reetha and shikakai can also be used together to curb hair fall. The ways in which these three ingredients can be combined are as easy to use as they are to create.
            </p>
            <img src="img/reetha oil.jfif" alt="">
            <h4>To prepare</h4>
            <pre>

                • Obtain Shikakai and boil these both in water.
                • Leave overnight to cool.
                • Strain this mixture in the morning.
            </pre>
            <h4>To Apply</h4>

            <h3>4.Shikakai</h3>
            <h4>Anti-Grey Hair Pack</h4>
            <p>An excellent pack made of Shikakai for grey hair blended with Henna powder, Amla powder, curry leaf powder and hibiscus flower works wonders for premature greying of hair.

            </p>
            <img src="img/shikakai oil.jfif" alt="">
            <h4>

                • Can apply this pack once a week or once in 15 days.
                • However, avoid using too much Henna powder since overusing it can dry up your hair.</pre>
            <br>
            <h3>5.coffee</h3>
            <p>A cup of brewed coffee can do more than just give you a caffeine boost. It can also help dye your hair a shade or two darker, and may even cover up some gray hair.
            </p>
            <img src="img/coffee oil.jfif" alt="">
            <h4>To dye your hair with coffee:</h4>
            <pre>
                • Brew a strong cup of dark-roast coffee.
                • Mix about 1/2 cup of coffee with 2 tbsp. of coffee grounds and 1 cup of leave-in hair conditioner.
                • Apply the mixture to clean, damp hair.
                • Let the mixture set for at least an hour, and wash it out when you’re done.
                • Repeat if necessary.</pre>
            <p>Coffee won’t provide a drastic change to your hair, and it won’t last for long. But if you need a quick and affordable boost, it’s a good option to try.

            <h3>6.Tea</h3>
            <h4>Herbal Dye Hair with Black Tea</h4>
            <img src="img/black tea oil.jfif" alt="">
            <p>
                Now that you’ve learned how black tea hair dye works and its benefits, learn how to dye hair with tea:
            </p>
            <pre>
                • Brew some strong tea using 3-5 teabags of black tea per one cup of water. For additional darkening, add some dried sage to the mixture. • Allow the tea to cool, then apply the tea to dry hair using a hair dye applicator bottle. • Let the tea sit in your hair for at least an hour. For more intense results, put on a shower cap and leave the tea in your hair overnight.
                • Rinse out hair thoroughly, then apply a lightweight nourishing conditioner like Viviscal Gorgeous Growth Densifying Conditioner.
            </pre>
            <p>
                Always do a skin test of any new hair dye or at-home beauty recipe before applying it to your hair and scalp. If you have sensitivities or allergies to the ingredients, don't use them. Repeating the dyeing process will give you darker, more intense results.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>7.Hibiscus</h3>
            <h4>Use Hibiscus Oil for Hair</h4>
            <p>
                Hibiscus oil benefits hair by improving blood circulation on the scalp and in the hair follicles. It can be used thrice a week to reap maximum benefits.
            </p>
            <pre>
                • Take a few leaves and flowers, around 8-10, and grind them into a fine paste.
                • Heat coconut oil and add the paste to it. Heat the mixture.
                • Let it cool down.
                • The oil is ready to use. Massage it on the scalp for a few minutes.
            </pre>
            <img src="img/hibiscus oil.webp" alt="">
            <h4>Use Hibiscus Powder for Hair</h4>
            <p>
                We can use hibiscus and amla masks to strengthen our hair follicles and maintaining scalp health. For this mask, mix hihbiscus powder and Amla powder in equal amounts in water to make a smooth paste. Keep it for about 30 minutes and rinse it off with a mild shampoo.
            </p>
            <h4>Use a Hibiscus Flower for Hair</h4>
            <h4>Hibiscus Hair Mask</h4>
            <p>The mask makes hair manageable and provides nourishment to the hair. For this,
                Grind about 3-4 hibiscus leaves and one hibiscus flower to make a paste.</p>
            <pre>
                • Add a cup of yoghurt to it.
            • Apply the paste to the hair and keep it for an hour.
            • Rinse it off with a mild shampoo.
            • Use it 1-2 times a week.
            • We can also add 3 spoons of ginger juice or 2 egg whites to the hibiscus flower paste to promote hair growth.
