                <p  >If you are reluctant to use chemicals on your scalp but want to cover greys, henna is a natural alternative.
                </p>
                <p> Henna prepared with the leaves of bhringaraj is
                    also helpful in dyeing the hair, according to 
                    experts. The oil contains haritaki and Jatamansi
                     which are extremely beneficial in maintaining the
                      natural colour of hair.</p></div>
                
                
                <h4>To Prepare Henna (Mehendi) Hair Color Pack</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Take henna powder in a bowl</li>
                <li>Sift this henna to ensure no lumps are present in the henna taken to apply on the hair</li>
                <li>Add a little black tea water in this henna</li>
                <li>And let it soak for over 6-8 hours</li>
                <li>Apply this paste on hair and wash it off with water (no shampoo or conditioner)</li>
                <li>Take a little indigo powder and add a little warm water to get a thick consistency</li>
                <li>Apply this paste on the hair and wash it off after 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Use a shampoo and a conditioner after 1-2 days of this entire process to get a deep black</li>
                </ul>
                    <br>
                    
                <h3>2.Amla</h3>
                
                <img src="img/amla oil.jfif" alt="" style="float: right;">
                <p> This amla-based hair mask is made using amla in combination with yoghurt and banana. Not only will it cleanse your hair and scalp but will also have long term benefits such as stronger roots and reduced hair fall.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    To prepare the amla hair mask</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Mix 1 teaspoon of amla with 3 teaspoons of yoghurt.</li>
                    <li> And half a mashed banana.</li>
                    <li> Apply this paste to your scalp and along the length of your hair.</li>
                    <li> Let it stay for 20 to 25 minutes before washing it off with water.</li>
                 </ul>
                <h4> Or as a hair rinse</h4>
                <p>  
                    Using an amla hair rinse is a great way to add a boost of proteins and antioxidants to your hair care routine. Add ½ cup of amla juice to 100ml water and pour it over your scalp and tresses.
                    After you’re done washing your hair, pour this hair rinse over your scalp and tresses. You can choose to wash it out but leaving it on will have greater effects for your hair health!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>3.Reetha</h3>
                <div>
                <img src="img/reetha oil.jfif" alt="" style="float: left;">
                <p> Reetha can be used for hair treatment in two different forms- liquid or powder. Other ingredients like amla, reetha and shikakai can also be used together to curb hair fall. The ways in which these three ingredients can be combined are as easy to use as they are to create.
                </p>
                <p>Apply it on your scalp and massage like shampoo.
                    Wash off with water.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                
                <ul> 
                    <h4>To prepare</h4>
                    <li> Remove the shell of 7-10 soap nuts.</li>
                    <li> Obtain Shikakai and boil these both in water.</li>
                    <li> Leave overnight to cool.</li>
                    <li> Strain this mixture in the morning.</li>
                </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                <h3>4.Shikakai</h3>
                
                <img src="img/shikakai oil.jfif" alt=""st>
                <p>An excellent pack made of Shikakai for grey hair blended with Henna powder, Amla powder, curry leaf powder and hibiscus flower works wonders for premature greying of hair. Henna is a natural colouring agent does no harm to the hair follicles, and Amla and Curry leaves are rich in anti-bodies that prevent hair damage and nourish it.
                </p>
                
                <h4>
                    To make this paste</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> take about 1/4th cup of Amla powder,</li>
                        <li> take about ½ cup of Henna powder,</li>
                        <li>A paste of 5-6 fresh Hibiscus flowers,</li>
                        <li>And 1/4th cup of fresh Curry leaf. Mix all of it with a little black brewed tea.</li>
                        <li>Can apply this pack once a week or once in 15 days.</li>
                        <li>However, avoid using too much Henna powder since overusing it can dry up your hair.</ul></li>
                    <br>
                    
                <h3>5.coffee</h3>
                <img src="img/coffee oil.jfif" alt="">
                <p>A cup of brewed coffee can do more than just give you a caffeine boost. It can also help dye your hair a shade or two darker, and may even cover up some gray hair.
                </p> <p>Coffee won’t provide a drastic change to your hair, and it won’t last for long. But if you need a quick and affordable boost, it’s a good option to try.
                </p>
                
                <h4>To dye your hair with coffee:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brew a strong cup of dark-roast coffee.</li>
                        <li>Mix about 1/2 cup of coffee with 2 tbsp. of coffee grounds and 1 cup of leave-in hair conditioner.</li>
                        <li>Apply the mixture to clean, damp hair.</li>
                        <li>Let the mixture set for at least an hour, and wash it out when you’re done.</li>
                        <li>Repeat if necessary.</ul></li>
                   
                <br>
                <h3>6.Tea</h3>
                <img src="img/black tea oil.jfif" alt="">
                <p>
                    Now that you’ve learned how black tea hair dye works and its benefits, learn how to dye hair with tea:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Always do a skin test of any new hair dye or at-home beauty recipe before applying it to your hair and scalp. If you have sensitivities or allergies to the ingredients, don't use them. Repeating the dyeing process will give you darker, more intense results.
                </p>
                <h4>Herbal Dye Hair with Black Tea</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brew some strong tea using 3-5 teabags of black tea per one cup of water. For additional darkening, add some dried sage to the mixture. </li>
                    <li>Allow the tea to cool, then apply the tea to dry hair using a hair dye applicator bottle.</li> 
                        <li>Let the tea sit in your hair for at least an hour. For more intense results, put on a shower cap and leave the tea in your hair overnight.</li>
                        <li>Rinse out hair thoroughly, then apply a lightweight nourishing conditioner like Viviscal Gorgeous Growth Densifying Conditioner</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>7.Hibiscus</h3>
                
                <img src="img/hibiscus oil.webp" alt="">
                <p>
                    Hibiscus oil benefits hair by improving blood circulation on the scalp and in the hair follicles. It can be used thrice a week to reap maximum benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can use hibiscus and amla masks to strengthen our hair follicles and maintaining scalp health. For this mask, mix hihbiscus powder and Amla powder in equal amounts in water to make a smooth paste. Keep it for about 30 minutes and rinse it off with a mild shampoo.
                </p>
                
                
                <h4>Use Hibiscus Oil for Hair</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take a few leaves and flowers, around 8-10, and grind them into a fine paste.</li>
                        <li>Heat coconut oil and add the paste to it.</li> 
                        <li>Heat the mixture.</li>
                        <li>Let it cool down.</li>
                        <li>The oil is ready to use. </li>
                        <li> Massage it on the scalp for a few minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Hibiscus Hair Mask</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a cup of yoghurt to it.</li>
                    <li>Apply the paste to the hair
                    and keep it for an hour.</li>
                <li>Rinse it off with a mild shampoo</li>
                
                <li>Use it 1-2 times a week</li>
                
                <li>We can also add 3 sp
                ons of ginger juice or 2 egg whites to the hibiscus flower paste to promote hair growth.</li>
                </ul>
