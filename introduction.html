            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>As compared to the chemical based hair dyes, natural herbal dyes are being preferred nowadays. Herbal drugs without any adverse effects are used for healthy hair. 70% of human beings above 50 years struggle with the problem of balding and graying of hair. Graying starts on the skin of head at about 40 years, starting initially from the temples, followed by beard and chest. People have been using natural dyes since ancient times for the purpose of dyeing carpets, rugs and clothings by the use of roots, stems, barks, leaves, berries and flowers. The need of herbal based natural medicines is increasing fastly due to their natural goodness and lack of side effects. Amla, Bhringraj, Henna, Mandara, Reetha, Sariva, Curry leaves and Methi seeds are well-known ayurvedic herbal drugs. Many different extracts from plant were used for the purpose of hair dyeing in Europe and Asia before the invention of modern dyes. Indigo, known as initial fabric dye, could be mixed with henna to create different shades of brown to black colour. Use of these chemicals can result in unpleasant side effects, such as skin irritation, allergy and breakage. Continual application of such compounds on natural hair causes multiple side effects such as hair fall, dry scalp, erythrema and also skin cancer. In India, henna has been used traditionally for colouring palms and hairs. There are so many herbs like Kikar, Bihi, Bhringraj, Patnag, Akhrot, Narra, Jaborandi, Jatamansi, Amla, Kuth, Giloe, Behera which are used as a major constituents in hair care preparations mainly meant for dyeing hair. Henna has been used traditionally for colouring women's bodies during marriage and other social celebrations since the times of Bronze Age. It is a part of Islamic and Hindu cultures as a hair coloring and dyeing agent for the purpose of decorating the nails or for the formation of temporary tattoos . In the present era of eco-conservation, the use of natural dyes has been revived and reviewed for the coloration of textiles and food materials. Drugs from the plant sources are easily available, are less expensive, safe, and efficient and rarely have side effects.
