            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Herbal based hair dyes are being preferred on large scale, due to the vast number of advantages it exerts to overcome the ill-effects of a chemical based hair dye. We have attempted to prepare and standardize this preparation to ensure its quality as well as stability aspects. Herbal dye was prepared in-house according to the proposed composition, using all the natural ingredients. The dye was subjected to various parameters such as organoleptic, physico-chemical, phytoconstituents, rheological aspects, patch test and stability testing for its efficacy and shelf life. The dye was evaluated for its organoleptic, physico-chemical and stability parameters. Results were found to be comparable and sufficient for the evaluation of herbal dye. The values of different evaluations justified the usage of the hair dye in the laboratory tests conducted by researchers at the University of Nottingham Trent University. Herbal based hair dye has been prepared and evaluated using the various parameters. It offers a natural alternate, which can be used, irrespective of any side effects. The results can be incorporated while developing the pharmacopoeial standards.
